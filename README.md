# Volunteer Tracker Demo

This is a functional demo of a project I built for a [local charity](https://matthewshouse.org.uk/), during my time as a volunteer. The demo showcases the basic features and functionality of the application, excluding user authentication and charity branding. It communicates with an API to update the database in real-time. The backend is built with Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB, while the frontend is built with React, Redux, and Material-UI.

You can view the functional demo [here](https://volunteer-tracker-demo.up.railway.app). *(The database is reset and seeded every 30 mins)*

## Features
The charity needed a more efficient way to manage their volunteers' information. The existing system required manual input and calculations to determine when certain activities, such as training, were due. The new system was designed to address these challenges and includes the following features:

- Users can search for upcoming information in a given number of days
  - List of volunteers and the training they require or when training has expired.
  - List of volunteers and the upcoming awards or overdue awards.
  - List of volunteers with upcoming birthdays.
  - List of volunteers with outstanding documents.
- Create, update and delete awards, documents, roles and training.
- Ability to add new volunteers.
- Ability to update existing volunteers' information.
- Archiving of volunteers who are currently not actively volunteering.
- Viewing and filtering a list of volunteers and their information.

## What I Have Learnt
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Gathering client requirements and prototyping.
- Implementing user authentication practices.
- Designing a REST API.
- Designing a NoSQL database.
- Building applications with React and Redux.
- Deploying projects to a production environment.
- Presenting projects and gathering feedback.

Bringing a project from initial design to deployment, where it can make a positive impact, has been an incredibly rewarding experience.

## Next Steps
I would like to add a notification system (mobile and/or email) that alerts the relevant users of the necssary upcoming information on a set schedule. This will allow users to avoid having to log in to check and make note.

## Feedback
Any feedback that you may have is welcome. I'm always looking for ways to improve and explore different approaches.
